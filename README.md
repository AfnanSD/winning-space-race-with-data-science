The goal of this project is to answer the quistion of wahter a spaceX rocket will land successfully or not

The steps followed can be seen in the different Jupyter notebooks in the repository:


### For data collection:

  - Web scraping
  
  - spaceX API
  

### For Data wrangling:

  - checking and dealing with missing data
  

### For EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):
  
  - Exploring data with SQL
  
  - Exploring data with data visualization
  
  - Exploring Launch Site locations with Folium library
  
  - Building interactive dashboard with plotly dash


### The models built:
  
  - Linear regression model
  
  - SVM
  
  - Tree desicion
  
  - KNN
  

Finally evaluating the models, the aquracy has reached 0.83
